			      CGImap 0.5
			      ==========

Overview
========

CGImap is a C++ implementation of the OpenStreetMap "map" call as an
FCGI process. The rails implementation of the "map" call has a few
problems with memory - it uses a lot of it and there is a leak which
makes it annoying to use in long-running environments, like the main
OSM server.

CGImap attempts to address these memory problems and makes it easier
to optimise the queries, something which is also a bit of a pain to do
in Rails.

Requirements
============

CGImap depends on the following libraries. Versions used during
development are in brackets. Other versions may work, but YMMV.

  * libxml2  (2.6.32.dfsg-4ubuntu1)
  * libpqxx  (???)
  * libfcgi  (2.4.0-7)
  * libboost (???)

If you're running a Debian or Ubuntu system these can be installed
using the following command:

  sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libpqxx3-dev libfcgi-dev libboost-dev

The build system used is GNU Make, using pkg-config to provide some of
the flags.

Setup
=====

A sample lighttpd.conf file is provided, which I've been using to
test. No testing has been done with other FCGI servers, but if you
find a problem please report it on the OSM trac.

CGImap expects the following environment variables to be set:

  * DB_HOST: Hostname or IP address of the database server.
  * DB_NAME: Name of the database.
  * DB_USER: Name of the user to connect as.
  * DB_PASS: Password of the user to connect as.

Optionally, DB_CHARSET can be set to the connection charset to
use. The default is "utf8".

CGImap requires permissions to SELECT and CREATE TEMPORARY on the
Postgres server. It is recommended that a separate account is created for
CGImap to avoid any possibility of data corruption. Care has been
taken programming CGImap but, as with most C++ applications, there is
the chance of an exploitable flaw leading to complete pwnage.
