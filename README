CGImap
======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zerebubuth/openstreetmap-cgimap.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/zerebubuth/openstreetmap-cgimap)

Overview
--------

CGImap is a C++ implementation of some parts of the OpenStreetMap
API as an FCGI process. The rails implementation of the "map" call
had a few problems with memory - it uses a lot of it and there is
a leak which makes it annoying to use in long-running environments,
such as the main OSM server.

CGImap attempts to address these memory problems and makes it easier
to optimise the queries, something which is also a bit of a pain to do
in Rails.

Currently, CGImap implements:

* the "map" API call,
* single node, way and relation fetches,
* multiple node, way and relation fetches,
* the "full" way and relation calls and
* changset metadata downloads, including discussions,
* single node, way and relation history calls,
* single node, way and relation specific version fetches,
* multiple node, way and relation specific version fetches,
* changeset downloads.

Note that changeset metadata isn't the same thing as the changeset
download (i.e: `osmChange` data).

Requirements
------------

CGImap uses a PostgreSQL server for either the APIDB or PGsnapshot backends. A minimum server version of 9.4 is required.

CGImap depends on the following libraries. Versions used during
development are in brackets. Other versions may work, but YMMV.

* libxml2     (2.9.3+dfsg1-1ubuntu0.2)
* libpqxx-4.0 (4.0.1+dfsg-3ubuntu2)
* libfcgi     (2.4.0-8.3)
* libboost    (1.58.0+dfsg-5ubuntu3.1)
* libcrypto++ (5.6.1-9)

If you're running a Debian or Ubuntu system these can be installed
using the following command:

    sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libpqxx-dev libfcgi-dev \
      libboost-dev libboost-regex-dev libboost-program-options-dev \
      libboost-date-time-dev libboost-filesystem-dev \
      libboost-system-dev libboost-locale-dev libmemcached-dev \
      libcrypto++-dev

Note that C++11 is _required_ to build CGImap.

The build system used is GNU Make, using pkg-config to provide some of
the flags.

Note that the full set of packages needed from a fresh install (tested
with Ubuntu 16.04) - you may already have many or all of these - is:

    sudo apt-get install git build-essential automake autoconf libtool

If you want to enable the experimental JSON format, then you'll also
need:

    sudo apt-get install libyajl-dev

To build the system from scratch, first check out the source code (skip
this step if you've already got the source):

    git clone git://github.com/zerebubuth/openstreetmap-cgimap.git

Then change to the source code directory to configure and build:

    cd openstreetmap-cgimap/
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make

You should now have a "./openstreetmap-cgimap" executable in the current
directory.

Setup
-----

To run CGImap binary, use the command:

    ./openstreetmap-cgimap --socket :54321 --backend apidb \
      --dbname openstreetmap

Note: CGImap has to be used with a fastcgi enabled server like lighttpd, apache2 etc. See the instructions below to use CGImap with lighttpd or apache2.

A sample lighttd.conf file is provided, which can be used to test. To test
CGImap with lighttpd you will need to install lighttpd:

	sudo apt-get install lighttpd

Edit the supplied lighttpd.config file to include your CGImap path and run it with the lighttpd like

	/usr/sbin/lighttpd -f lighttpd.conf

You can then access the running instance at `http://localhost:31337/api/0.6/map?bbox=...`

The api.osm.org instance runs CGImap as a daemon and Apache with
[mod_fastcgi_handler](https://github.com/hollow/mod_fastcgi_handler).
An init.d script to run CGImap as a daemon is supplied in
scripts/cgimap.init. To use it modify the paths and environment
variables to suit your installation, copy it to `/etc/init.d/cgibin` and
change the mode to 755, and owner:group to root:root.

An example of this can be found in
[OSM Chef](http://git.openstreetmap.org/chef.git/blob/HEAD:/cookbooks/web/recipes/cgimap.rb).

Typically you will need to modify the database connection parameters and path
to the executable. See `./openstreetmap-cgimap --help` for a list of options.
To convert a command line option to an environment variable append `CGIMAP_` to
the option and capatalize it. For example, the option `--dbname` becomes the
environment variable `CGIMAP_DBNAME`.

Fcgi programs can be deployed with Apache using `mod_fastcgi_handler`,
`mod_fcgid`, `mod_fastcgi`, and on recent versions `mod_proxy_fcgi`. A sample
Apache configuration file that will work in conjunction with CGImap as a
daemon is supplied in `scripts/cgibin.conf`. To use this on a Ubuntu-based
system you need to copy the cofiguration to where Apache will read it and
create an api directory:

    sudo cp scripts/cgimap.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/cgimap
    sudo chmod 644 /etc/apache2/sites-available/cgimap
    sudo chown root:root /etc/apache2/sites-available/cgimap
    sudo mkdir /var/www/api
    sudo a2ensite cgimap
    sudo service apache2 restart

The apache modules mod_proxy and mod_fastcgi_handler must also be enabled.

Database Permissions
--------------------

The apidb backend requires permissions to SELECT and CREATE TEMPORARY on the
Postgres server. For situations where temporary tables cannot be created there
is the `--readonly` option.

The pgsnapshot backend requires permissions to SELECT and CREATE TEMPORARY on
the Postgres server, but will not work in situations where temporary tables
cannot be created.

In both cases it is recommended that a separate account is created for
CGImap to avoid any possibility of data corruption. Care has been
taken programming CGImap but, as with most C++ applications, there is
the chance of an exploitable flaw leading to complete pwnage.

Testing
-------

To run the test suite using `make check` you will need additional
packages installed:

    sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib postgis

And you will need to be able to create databases as your user:

    sudo -u postgres createuser -s $USER

Formatting
----------

The CGImap code is formatted using
[clang-format](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) in a style
which is based on the "LLVM style" which ships with
`clang-format`. Note that version 3.6 or later is needed to avoid
introducing problems with formatting try-catch blocks. To enable an
automatic reformatting option, provide the `--with-clang-format`
option to `configure` and then reformatting can be done across the
whole set of source files by running:

    make clang-format

Ideally, this should be done before committing each set of changes.
