CGImap
======

Overview
--------

CGImap is a C++ implementation of the OpenStreetMap "map" call as an
FCGI process. The rails implementation of the "map" call has a few
problems with memory - it uses a lot of it and there is a leak which
makes it annoying to use in long-running environments, like the main
OSM server.

CGImap attempts to address these memory problems and makes it easier
to optimise the queries, something which is also a bit of a pain to do
in Rails.

Requirements
------------

CGImap depends on the following libraries. Versions used during
development are in brackets. Other versions may work, but YMMV.

* libxml2  (2.7.8.dfsg-5.1ubuntu4.4)
* libpqxx3 (3.1-1)
* libfcgi  (2.4.0-8.1)
* libboost (1.48.0.2)

If you're running a Debian or Ubuntu system these can be installed
using the following command:

    sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libpqxx3-dev libfcgi-dev \
      libboost-dev libboost-regex-dev libboost-program-options-dev \
      libboost-date-time-dev libmemcached-dev

The build system used is GNU Make, using pkg-config to provide some of
the flags.

Note that the full set of packages needed from a fresh install (tested
with Ubuntu 13.04) - you may already have many or all of these - is:

    sudo apt-get install git build-essential automake autoconf

To build the system from scratch, first check out the source code (skip
this step if you've already got the source):

    git clone git://github.com/zerebubuth/openstreetmap-cgimap.git

Then change to the source code directory to configure and build:

    cd openstreetmap-cgimap/
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --with-fcgi=/usr
    make

You should now have a "./map" executable in the current directory.

Setup
-----

A sample lighttpd.conf file is provided, which can be used to test. To test 
CGImap with lighttpd use the supplied config file with lighttpd and run cgimap
on the command line with a command like

    ./map --port 54321 --backend apidb --dbname openstreetmap

You can then access the running instance at `http://localhost:31337/api/0.6/map?bbox=...`

The api.osm.org instance runs CGImap as a daemon and Apache with 
[mod_fastcgi_handler](https://github.com/hollow/mod_fastcgi_handler).
An init.d script to run CGImap as a daemon is supplied in
scripts/cgimap.init. To use it modify the paths and environment 
variables to suit your installation, copy it to `/etc/init.d/cgibin` and 
change the mode to 755, and owner:group to root:root.

An example of this can be found in 
[OSM Chef](http://git.openstreetmap.org/chef.git/blob/HEAD:/cookbooks/web/recipes/cgimap.rb).

Typically you will need to modify the database connection parameters and path
to the executable. See `./map --help` for a list of options. To convert a
command line option to an environment variable append `CGIMAP_` to the option
and capatalize it. For example, the option `--dbname` becomes the environment
variable `CGIMAP_DBNAME`.

Fcgi programs can be deployed with Apache using `mod_fastcgi_handler`,
`mod_fcgid`, `mod_fastcgi`, and on recent versions `mod_proxy_fcgi`. A sample
Apache configuration file that will work in conjunction with CGImap as a
daemon is supplied in `scripts/cgibin.conf`. To use this on a Ubuntu-based
system you need to copy the cofiguration to where Apache will read it and
create an api directory:

	sudo cp scripts/cgimap.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/cgimap
    sudo chmod 644 /etc/apache2/sites-available/cgimap
    sudo chown root:root /etc/apache2/sites-available/cgimap
	sudo mkdir /var/www/api
    sudo a2ensite cgimap
    sudo service apache2 restart

The apache modules mod_proxy and mod_fastcgi_handler must also be enabled.

Database Permissions
--------------------

The apidb backend requires permissions to SELECT and CREATE TEMPORARY on the 
Postgres server. For situations where temporary tables cannot be created there 
is the `--readonly` option.

The pgsnapshot backend requires permissions to SELECT and CREATE TEMPORARY on 
the Postgres server, but will not work in situations where temporary tables 
cannot be created.

In both cases it is recommended that a separate account is created for
CGImap to avoid any possibility of data corruption. Care has been
taken programming CGImap but, as with most C++ applications, there is
the chance of an exploitable flaw leading to complete pwnage.

Testing
-------

To run the test suite using `make check` you will need additional 
packages installed:

    sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib ruby libxml-ruby \
      ruby-pg

And you will need to be able to create databases as your user:

    sudo -u postgres createuser $USER
    (say yes to superuser)
