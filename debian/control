Description: CGImap is a C++ implementation of the OpenStreetMap API map call
 CGImap is a C++ implementation of some parts of the OpenStreetMap API as an
 FCGI process. The rails implementation of the "map" call had a few problems
 with memory - it uses a lot of it and there is a leak which makes it annoying
 to use in long-running environments, like the main OSM server.
 .
 CGImap attempts to address these memory problems and makes it easier to
 optimise the queries, something which is also a bit of a pain to do in Rails.
